# odin-recipes
This is a recipes project that I will be working on to really get familiar with HTML, even become best friends with it since I already know a decent amount of HTML already. This will be a refresher.
By the time I complete this part of the project today, I will have demonstrated tho knowledge to:
Write up an HTML boilerplate from memory (I'll try not to google unless I have to)
Use absolute and relative paths and as well as practice with lists among other HTML elements.
